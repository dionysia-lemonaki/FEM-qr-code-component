- [Self-hosting fonts explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK-yy6C2Nck&t=65s) - This video by Kevin Powell taught me how to self-host static Google fonts.
- [google-webfonts-helper](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts) - This tool helped me convert .ttf fonts to .woff2.
- [Invisible Content Just for Screen Reader Users](https://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/) â€“ This article by WebAIM helped me hide content with CSS while making it visible to screen readers. I used the code from the "Absolutely positioning content off-screen" section to pass Axe's accessibility checks on the Frontend Mentor website which were failing because I was missing an `h1` element.
